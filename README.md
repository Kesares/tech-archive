# Welcome to the Tech Archive 🎉

Welcome to my Tech Archive. At this stage, it is still more of a growing collection of notes than a comprehensive
library. However, every project starts small — and this one is no exception.

⚠️ Please note: The main content is currently **only available in German**.

## The Goal 🎯

Imagine entering a digital library where you can explore lines of code and technological knowledge. Welcome to my Tech
Archive, a growing repository of bits and bytes that you might find useful someday.

This archive aims to provide a continually expanding collection of information, notes, guides, and all things
IT-related. Whether you are an experienced developer looking to refresh your skills or a curious beginner wondering why
"Hello World!" is so important — you are in the right place.

## What to expect here? 🤔

Currently, the Tech Archive covers three main topics: HTML, Java, and Mathematics. Java provides a solid introduction to
the world of programming.

There is still relatively little content available for HTML, and in Mathematics I am just beginning to shed some light on
the often abstract world of numbers and formulas. So don’t worry if you don’t find a lot of content here yet.

In addition to the topic-specific content, there is a digital toolbox with useful links and resources to support you on
your IT journey. From helpful articles to practical tools – feel free to explore and expand your digital toolbox.

💡 Note: The archive contains highlighted terms that are explained in the glossary.

## Why an archive at all? 🤷‍♂️

I believe that knowledge should be shared – no matter how much or how little it is. That’s why I started this archive: a
place to collect my thoughts and notes – for myself, but also for others. It may still be in its early stages, but over
time it will grow – much like the number of tabs you have open while learning or working.

## Stay tuned! 🌱

Even though the archive is just getting started, I have many ideas that I plan to implement gradually. As it grows,
topics may be re-categorized or re-organized to maintain clarity. Feel free to check back regularly.
